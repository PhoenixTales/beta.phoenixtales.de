  <p><strong>24.12.20</strong> | Flosha: And another announcement to make. I've made a new website and we have a new domain for it: <a href="https://phoenixthegame.com">phoenixthegame.com</a>. There you can find everything about PHOENIX (so far known under its working title Project Nyx). New infos included. Merry Christmas.</p>

  <p><strong>24.12.20</strong> | Flosha: We have a gift for you. Today we release v0.7.1 of our Gothic Archive. Some highlights: All <a href="archive/screenshots/orderedbylocation.html">Screenshots ordered by location</a>, exclusive <a href="archive/music/">Pre-Alpha Music</a>, the first <a href="archive/documents/PhoenixPitch.pdf">Gothic ('Phoenix') Pitch</a>, a <a href="archive/promotion/presskit2001/index.htm">PressKit</a> never seen before and a lot of minor fixes, mobile optimization and little improvements; all to be found in our <a href="archive/changelog.html">changelog</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>23.12.20</strong> | Flosha: I've changed the design of our website and rewrote its code. Simple mobile optimization included, but still in pure Html+CSS (no Javascript).</p>

  <p><strong>29.07.20</strong> | Flosha: Martin Dietrich was so kind to send me his record of the interview we gave him in May this year (for his <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/making-of-gothic,3359642.html">GOTHIC report</a>). I've transcribed it and I'm happy to present <a href="nyx/interviews/GameStar_24-05-20.html">the edited transcript here</a> (german only):</p>

  <p><strong>09.04.20</strong> | Flosha: I've created a little mood teaser: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjBzNinOgj4">Gothic Meets Acrobatics</a>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>21.03.20</strong> | Flosha: We can finally declare the release of the first, official version (0.5) of the <a href="archive/">GOTHIC ARCHIVE</a>. An urgently needed and comprehensive work of historical value, as we think. Thank you to all contributors. <a href="archive/README.txt">Readme</a>.</p>
